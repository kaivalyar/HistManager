## Synopsis

### Motivation
The default history management system of the terminal can sometimes seem clunky and unhelpful. While the terminal is versatile and facilitates a wide variety of tasks, the terminal command history can only be accessed as a single obscenely-long list. When using the terminal, this often makes it difficult to scroll to the desired commands, especially for novice users.

### Objective
This project aims to simplify terminal history management, by splitting each use of the terminal into a _session_, with an _environment_. The user can select the environment of the terminal upon startup, and thus obtain clutter free access to all the commands executed in that particular environment, with other environments' history not in the picture. For example, when working on a Java Applet, the user may choose to use a Java environment, which would provide only the Java environments' terminal history - and not show any Python commands that were executed from the Python environment. The current version is intended to work only for a single instance of the _Terminal_ application running at a time - and not for multiple tabs/windows. It is also not meant for the main linux terminal (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `F1`-`F7`)

### Strategy
The history of the bash terminal, by default, is stored in the `~/.bash_history` file. HistManager works by constantly editing this file - replacing it with a different file (based on the environment history the user wants to import). This way, the system still uses the default, `.bash_history` file to both add and retrieve commands, but the file iself is managed by HistManager - thus changing the history on demand. Additions to environment histories also occur this way - the system edits the `.bash_history` file, and the edits are copied into the relevant environment history file by HistManager.

Apart from all the user generated environments, there is another, 'Master' environment - which can't be edited by the user. This environment is special, as it contains all the history, from all the environments. Thus, selecting the Master environment for a terminal session has the same effect as continuing with the default `.bash_history` file.

### Lingo

* Environments: Different terminal _environments_ differ in the history they possess, and prevent other environments' commands from showing up when accessing history (either via the `history` command, or via the arrow keys).
  * Archived Environments: Environments that have been archived by the user, and are not to be displayed in the Environment Menu anymore.
  * Error Generated Environments: Environments that contain the history of terminal sessions who's environments couldn't be initialised correctly.
  * Pre Merge Environments: Archived environments containing copies of the history of two environments before they were merged.
  * The Master Environment: The single environment that contains all the history, from all environments.
* Sessions: Each time the terminal is opened, a _session_ is said to be started. HistManager currently can't handle multiple sessions running simultaneously.
* User Menus
  * Environment Menu: The main menu displayed upon terminal startup.
  * HistManager-Settings Menu: The menu display containing options to create new environments, archive environments, rename environments, etc.
  * Settings Submenus: The menus displayed for each action executed via the Settings menu, like those for renaming or archiving environments.

### Pizzazz
Apart from just replacing the `.bash_history` file appropriately, HistManager provides some more features.

#### HistManager Settings Menu
Enabling the user to create new environments is the only necessary feature required for HistManager to function. However, HistManager goes beyond this and allows renaming, merging and archiving existing environments. These features can be accessed from the `HistManager Settings` menu.

#### Quirks and Hacks
Here is a list of other quirks in the program. These aren't listed anywhere else, as they are not essential to the core functionality offered by the code.

* Environment Names
  * All environment names are case insensitive. Thus, _projectX_ and _projectx_ are identical to _ProjectX_.
  * Environment names can't contain special characters or whitespace, but the '+', '-', and '_' symbols are still allowed in environment names.
  * An environment can't be named '_Master_' or '_HistManager-Settings_'.
  * Environment names cant contain the words '_archive_', '_error-env_', or '_pre-merge_'.
* Menus
  * All `(y/n)` menus are case insensitive; and consider `Y`, `y`, `Yes`, and `yes` to be identical; and `N`, `n`, `No`, and `no` to be identical.
  * When choosing environments from a list, typing environment names functions the same as typing their serial numbers.
  * Pressing _Enter_ (or _Return_) when accessing any of the settings features, such as _rename_ or _merge_, returns to the _HistManager Settings_ menu.
  * Pressing _Enter_ (or _Return_) when accessing the _HistManager Settings_ menu returns to the _Environment Menu_ .
  * Pressing _Enter_ (or _Return_) at the _Environment Menu_ loads the environment from the previous session of the Terminal, if any.
  * When at the _Environment Menu_, the decimal numbers _0.1_ through _0.7_ offer direct access to the first through the seventh options from the _HistManager Settings_ menu, respectively. All other _0.x_ decimals open up the _HistManager Settings_ menu.
  * When selecting a display mode for viewing environment history, negative menu options can be used too, to sort the output alphabetically, rather than chronologically.
* Merging Environments
  * When two environments are merged, their individual histories are first archived, and can thus be retrieved.
* A Secret
  * While the 'Quirks and Hacks' section here is meant to document any features that may not be obvious at first glance, one of them has been omitted. To discover this secret, hidden feature, use the source, or find it in the HistManager-Settings. Knowledge from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the Big Bang Theory, or even the works of Pierre de Fermat could come in handy!

## Set Up

### Installation
The installation module of this project is a work in progress. For now, follow the following steps to install:
 1. Download and move these files into your home directory:
    * `install-histmanager.sh` (the installation Shell Script)
    * `histmanager-code` (the Python3 HistManager code)
    * `histmanager-code-remover` (the Python3 HistManager uninstall code)
    * `shistmanager-code-remover` (the uninstallation Shell Script)
 2. Close any existing Terminal windows, and open a new window.
 3. Type `sh install-histmanager.sh`
 4. Move the `BashHistoryBackup_yyyy-mm-dd_hh-mm-ss.txt` file created in your home directory to an appropriate location.
 4. Move the `uninstall-histmanager.sh` file created in your home directory to an appropriate location. **Do not delete this file**.
 5. Restart the Terminal to check installation and begin using HistManager.

###Uninstallation
The uninstallation module of this project is also a work in progress. For now, follow the following steps to uninstall:
 1. Move the `uninstall-histmanager.sh` file created at installation time back into your home directory.
 2. Open the Terminal, and select the _Master_ environment, if possible.
 3. Type `sh uninstall-histmanager.sh`
 4. Restart the Terminal to check if uninstallation was successful.
